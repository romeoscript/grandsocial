              <li>
                Company has and will continue to integrate with ad accounts from Linked Services (the “Post Sponsoring Feature” and the "Ads Manager Feature"). <strong>By using the Post Sponsoring Feature or the Ads Manager Feature, the User: (i) agrees to strictly adhere to the Linked Service's advertising policies; and (ii) accepts the risk of any adjustments made by the Linked Service which may cause an unintentional increase or decrease to the budget that will be used by the Linked Service.</strong> For example, the Company’s integration with the Facebook Marketing API accurately reflects Facebook's stated foreign currency offset as of October 1, 2018, and will be periodically updated, but there is a risk that Facebook may adjust the foreign currency offset and temporarily render the Company’s API inaccurate. It is the User's sole responsibility to continuously monitor the charges made by any Linked Services and to terminate the advertising campaign in the event the User’s budget is exceeded. <strong>MegaSocial shall in no way be held liable and hereby explicitly disclaims any responsibility for any charges that User may incur that relate to the Post Sponsoring Feature or the Ads Manager Feature.</strong>

              <li>WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, USERS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT AND CANNOT CONTROL THE FLOW OF DATA TO OR FROM THE SERVICES AND OTHER PORTIONS OF THE INTERNET.

              <li>Upon termination of Collaborator’s license granted in these Terms of Use, all licenses granted and all services provided to Collaborator under these Terms of Use shall terminate immediately.</li>
              <li>The Company may at any time and without notice terminate Owner’s license upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) Owner requests to terminate account; or (2) Owner breaches or defaults under any material term of condition of these Terms of Use; or (3) fails to timely pay any required subscription fees.</li>
            </ul>

          <li><span class="underline">Indemnification.</span> In addition to Users’ obligation to indemnify under Sections 5(d) and (g), Users agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, and manager from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and actions, including the payment of all legal expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, arising out of or connected with (i) these Terms of Use, (ii) the submission of any content by any User that infringes on or constitutes a misappropriation of any patent, copyright, or trade secret, or any other intellectual property right of any person or entity anywhere in the world or (iii) any disputes between Users relating to the Company’s Services or any agreements made between those Users.

          <li><span class="underline">Proprietary and other Notices.</span> Users agree that they will not alter or remove any trademarks or copyright notices and disclaimers located or used on, or in connection with, the Services or any printouts of the Services allowed under these Terms of Use.</li>

          <li>
            <span class="underline">Fees and Payment.</span>

            <ul>
              <li>Owner will pay Company all applicable fees and any related taxes (other than taxes on Company’s income) for use of the Services. Company may change its fees for current paying Owners by providing advanced written notice to such paying Owners. Owner authorizes Company to charge the applicable fees to the payment card that Owner submits to Company and agrees that a third-party credit card processing company may store such financial information. Owner will pay all fees and taxes as they become due. Owner’s obligation to pay fees continues through the end of the subscription period. If Owner’s payment card issuer or bank does not honor charges Owner has paid using Owner’s card, Owner will remain directly liable to Company for all unpaid amounts. Owner may cancel his or her subscription by sending an email to contact@grandsocial.org or through the Owner’s account on Grandsocial.org.</li>
              <li>By signing up for a subscription, Owner agrees that his or her subscription will be automatically renewed upon completion of the subscription term. Unless Owner cancels prior to the completion of the subscription term, Owner authorizes Company to charge the payment card provided for the renewal term. The period of auto-renewal will be the same as the initial monthly or yearly subscription period unless otherwise disclosed to Owner at the time of subscription purchase. The renewal rate will be no more than the rate for the immediately prior subscription period, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless Owner is notified of a rate change prior to the auto-renewal. Owner must cancel his or her subscription in accordance with the cancellation procedures in Section 19(a) or as otherwise agreed in writing. Company will not refund fees that may have accrued to Owner’s account and will not prorate fees for a cancelled subscription.</li>
              <li>Nonpayment of any fees or other sums due to Company or any other party related to Owner’s use of the Services will result in termination. Company may, at its discretion, also appoint an outside debt collection agency to collect amounts owed to Company. Owner agrees to reimburse Company for all costs that Company incurs in enforcing its collection of Owner’s unpaid amounts, including debt collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys’ and legal fees and court costs.</li>
              <li>All overcharges or billing disputes must be reported within 30 days of the date that the dispute occurred. If Owner disputes a charge to his or her payment card issuer that, in the Company’s reasonable judgment, is a valid charge under the provision of this Agreement, Owner agrees to reimburse the Company for its reasonable costs incurred in connection with the investigation of the matter.  Company will refund any such fees if the investigation finds that Owner’s action in disputing the charge to his or her card issuer was justified because the charge was not, in fact, a valid charge under the provisions of this Agreement.</li>
              <li>All fees and charges are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.</li>
              <li>Upon cancellation of a subscription or free trial, Company shall switch calendars to view only mode and continue to toll analytics for a period of one (1) month to prevent a gap in data in the event that the Owner desires to renew their subscription.</li>
              <li>In the event that an Owner desires to modify his or her subscription plan to gain additional capabilities provided by the Company’s Services (“Upgrade”), the increase in charge is automatically adjusted and applied to the Owner’s account for the current term and all future renewals. The Company does offer pro-rated adjustments where appropriate. An Upgrade occurs when either an Owner (i) changes from a lower to a higher tier plan, or (ii) changes from a monthly to yearly subscription but maintains the same tier plan.</li>
              <li>In the event that an Owner desires to modify their subscription plan to have fewer capabilities provided by the Company’s Services (“Downgrade”), the decrease in charge is only applied after the subscription term concludes. A Downgrade occurs when an Owner (i) changes from a higher to a lower tier plan, or (ii) changes from a yearly to a monthly subscription but maintains the same plan. Downgrade may only occur at the end of a subscription term whether monthly or yearly. In the event of a Downgrade, the subscription tier will be maintained, but will not renew. Once the term for that subscription concludes, a new subscription reflecting the Downgrade will commence.</li>
